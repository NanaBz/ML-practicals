- **Assignment 1.ipynb**: Contains solutions and explanations for Assignment 1, covering fundamental machine learning concepts and tasks.
- **Decision_trees.ipynb**: Demonstrates the implementation and analysis of decision tree algorithms, including visualization and evaluation.
- **Lecture3_2_1.ipynb**: Lecture notebook focusing on specific machine learning topics, likely related to classification or regression (update with more details as needed).
- **Lecture3_2_2s.ipynb**: Continuation or supplementary material for Lecture 3.2.1, with additional examples or exercises.
- **moons dataset explanation.ipynb**: Explains the moons dataset, commonly used for classification tasks, including data visualization and model fitting.
- **Nanakwaku_Boakye-Akyeampong_Assignment1_Classification.ipynb**: Assignment notebook by Nanakwaku Boakye-Akyeampong, focusing on classification problems and solutions.
- **Week05L02_SVM_DecisionTree.ipynb**: Practical notebook for Week 5, covering Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Decision Tree algorithms, with hands-on examples.

This README will be updated as new files are added or existing files are modified.
